The company culture here lacks genuine support with no acknowlegement or resources of mental health issues related to being a healthcare worker, pre- and post-pandemic.": 0,
                            "As SLPs in the schools, we are paid according to the teachers' salary scale; however, SLPs often fall into many gray areas and are not treated equitably.  We don't get an extra 45 minute prep per week like classroom teachers do (for planning), our caseloads are not capped at 25, we are expected to complete Medicaid log notes on our own time; yet, we are expected to pay for CEUs to maintain our licensure.   The inequities are numerous.  Teachers are provided with substitute coverage so that they can test their students' reading levels.  We are provided with a 1 hour testing slot for re-evaluation testing per week.  This is not nearly enough time to test a student for his/her re-eval, so we often pull students during our lunch or prep.  Teachers routinely attend various trainings/meetings where they are away from their class.  We don't even have dept. meetings during the school day because we are not supposed to cancel students' sessions.  It's very frustrating to feel like we're the underdog and no one really cares about fairness and how it impacts our mental health.": 1,

The UFT can help, but only so much. This can also be a factor in mental well-being: whether or not you have a good boss.

This has many pros and cons, the cons being when workload gets too high there is no one who seems to care to support me. Concerns often seem to fall on deaf ears if I can even find a time for anyone to meet with me. The special education department has a lot of turnover which means that new employees need much more support than seasoned ones and I\u2019m expected to just keep doing what I\u2019m doing even if there are many workload issues that lead to me not being able to provide the best services for my students.
